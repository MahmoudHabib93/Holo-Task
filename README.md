# Cypress JavaScript Test Automation Setup

## Overview
This project uses **Cypress** for JavaScript-based test automation. The following steps guide you through setting up the project, running tests, and generating HTML reports using **cypress-mochawesome-reporter**.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (v12 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)

## Step 1: Install Cypress
To get started, install Cypress using npm:

```bash
npm install cypress --save-dev
```

## Step 2: Open Cypress Test Runner
Once Cypress is installed, you can open the Cypress Test Runner using the following command:

```bash
npx cypress open
```

This command opens the Cypress UI, where you can write and execute tests.

## Step 3: Run Tests in Headless Mode
To run tests in headless mode (without the UI), use:

```bash
npx cypress run
```

This command runs all tests in the command line and generates a video of each test execution.

## Step 4: Generating HTML Report with Mochawesome
You can use the **cypress-mochawesome-reporter** to generate an HTML report.

### Install the Plugin
First, install the Mochawesome reporter:

```bash
npm install --save-dev cypress-mochawesome-reporter
```

### Step 5: Configure Cypress for Mochawesome

In your `cypress.config.js` file, add the following lines to configure the reporter:

```javascript
const { defineConfig } = require('cypress');

module.exports = defineConfig({
  reporter: 'cypress-mochawesome-reporter',
  e2e: {
    setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
      require('cypress-mochawesome-reporter/plugin')(on);
    },
  },
});
```

### Step 6: Register Mochawesome in `e2e.js`
In the `cypress/support/e2e.js` file, add this line to register the reporter:

```javascript
import 'cypress-mochawesome-reporter/register';
```

### Step 7: Run Tests and View HTML Report

After the setup is complete, run your tests:

```bash
npx cypress run
```

Once the tests are complete, the HTML report will be generated at: `cypress/reports/html/index.html`.

## Folder Structure
- **cypress/integration**: This folder contains all test files.
- **cypress/support**: Custom commands and configurations are placed here.
- **cypress/fixtures**: Store test data files here.
- **cypress/reports**: HTML reports generated by Mochawesome will be saved in this folder.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues with Cypress or test execution, refer to the [Cypress documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/).
